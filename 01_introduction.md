# Introduction

- **Software architecture** consists of:
  - System structure
  the high-level decomposition of the system into modules, components, layers, etc. It's about what parts composes the system and how they interact.
  - Architecture characteristics (Quality attributes) (ilities)
  the non functional requirements of the system that drive decisions such as availability, maintainability, testability, etc.
  - Architecture decisions
  key decisions taken while designing/constructing the system such as "we have chosens microservices architecture for team independence".
  - Design principles
  general guidelines that should be followed while designing/constructing system components such as "Prefer immutability over mutability for easier maintainability and predictable system behavior".
